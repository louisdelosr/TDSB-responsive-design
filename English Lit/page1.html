       <span id='textspan'>Making the Most of 12 Minutes: Guided Reading</span><span id='textspan1'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan2'>Guided reading instruction supports small groups of students to develop strategic approaches in making meaning of text.  In English/Literacy, we provided a differentiated response to an incredibly high-demand for support related to guided reading across TDSB.  We began rich conversations, provided varied supports for classroom use and inquired together across TDSB in sessions targeted to the Primary and Junior/Intermediate levels.  We met with teachers across the city in one-day sessions, 3-part modules and when demand was still high we offered sessions by Family of Schools to ensure opportunities and participation was available across the Board.<br /><br />Over 1400 teachers, including Superintendents and School Administrators engaged with us to address these learning goals to:<br /><br />Explore the purpose, learning goals, and expectations in support of teacher planning for guided instruction in reading<br />Network with each other<br />Think about this inquiry question:  “What impact would guided instruction have on student reading?”</span><br />

       <span id='textspan3'>Catching Up with Running Records</span><span id='textspan4'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan5'>Running records are a high-yields assessment strategy for reading developed by Marie Clay in the 1980s. Using running records with students allows teachers to capture student thinking and document progress over time. The English/Literacy Department partnered with Reading Recovery Teacher Leaders to offer a two-part module of learning for primary teachers to be trained in the coding and analyzing of running records. Thanks to the participation of the TDSB Reading Recovery Teacher Leaders, 120 TDSB primary teachers received the gold standard of training in running records as endorsed by the Canadian Institute of Reading Recovery.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan6'>I appreciated how the training enabled us to do running records and how it was broken down into components.  In my opinion, this detailed training is valuable for everyone. At our table, there was a Junior LD teacher and an Intermediate MART.  The reach of running records and their value is extending beyond the primary division.</span><br /><br />- Barbara Chee, Joseph Brant ES<br />

       <span id='textspan7'>Raising the Profile of Poetry in the TDSB: Urban Voices/L’écho de la ville</span><br /><br /><span id='textspan8'>Research demonstrates that teaching students to read and write poetry helps improve achievement in reading and writing, especially for students who struggle in literacy. Once again the English/Literacy Department offered a four-part course on how to teach poetry. Sessions ran in both the east and west quadrants of the TDSB. Particpants in the course demonstrated leadership back at their schools in supporting their colleagues to teach poetry as well as vetting submissions from their schools for the annual Urban Voices/ L’écho de la ville Anthology. Successful submissions were celebrated with student poets reading their poems at regional celebrations on June 3rd, 2014 in the rotunda at Scarborough Civic Centre and June 4th at John English Junior and Middle School.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan9'>I am better able to engage student reading and writing because I have learned through the Poetry Course that poetry is such an accessible, and essential, form of text. As well, the evolving process of writing, from drafting, through to revising and editing has had a direct impact on students being motivated to publish and share their voices for an authentic audience. </span><br /><br />- Shannon Kranjec, John A.

       <span id='textspan10'>The Right To Write: Grades 4 - 8</span><span id='textspan11'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan12'>Writing is an important vehicle for student voice and agency in the world. The skill of writing takes students today beyond traditional print and into a variety of digital and online platforms. Writing has moved beyond the classroom and into many local and global contexts. Creating authentic and purposeful reasons for students to write is key to their engagement with writing. Through this two-part module teachers explored evidence-based strategies that improve student achievement in writing.  Teachers collaborated to inspire their students to be effective writers in all subject areas.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan13'>Levelled Literacy Intervention</span><span id='textspan14'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan15'>TDSB teachers are turning struggling readers into successful readers!  The English\Literacy Department has completed the third year of a project to implement the Levelled Literacy Intervention (LLI) Kit developed by Gay Sue Pinnell and Irene Fountas as a resource to support Guided Reading in Grade 1 classrooms throughout the TDSB. The LLI Kit includes over 1000 books ranging from the JK-Grade 1 reading levels. There are also supplementary teacher resources to help guide instruction included in the kit. This project has included a strong partnership with the Early Years Department, Reading Recovery and the Research Department.  Attitude surveys were given to both teachers and students at the onset of the project and at its conclusion. Teachers reported an increase in their capacity to implement Guided Reading. Student engagement in reading also improved.  Demonstrated growth in student achievement was documented through DRA and running records taken during the course of the project.  We are once again building capacity and sustainability this year. The pilot year saw the LLI kit in 8 schools.  Last year, over 20 schools were using the kit and this year the LLI Kit will be used in over 60 TDSB schools.</span><br />

The Health and Physical Education and English Literacy Departments co-facilitated a module of learning for the Academies (Sport and Health and Wellness, Girls’ Leadership, Boys’ Leadership) to provide suggestions for integrated learning, linking the Language expectations to those in Health and Physical Education so that students could demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways. <br /><br />Some of the learning goals included:<br /><br />To network with each otherTo explore how we might support students with the Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy<br />To build inclusivity in our classrooms and re-shape classroom curriculum to be more culturally relevant and responsive<br />To explore how we might monitor our students in producing more thoughtful reading responses <br />To document the impact of our teaching</span><br />

       <span id='textspan19'>Differentiated Book Loan Library</span><span id='textspan20'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan21'>In 2012/13 the English/Literacy department established a Differentiated Book Loan library of “fresh, hot” novels and memoirs for use in secondary classrooms.  The books are intended to be used in Differentiated Book Club settings where students choose the text they would like to read and discuss the book with other readers of the same text. Each teacher can borrow up to 10 copies of any of the titles available for up to a 6 week period. Creating a community of readers has encouraged students to increase their reading stamina. Many students not only read the book they chose for Book Club, but in addition all of the titles that are offered in the Book Club unit. In this setting, students apply reading, writing and oral communication strategies including critical thinking to the texts. Professional learning sessions and exploration classrooms throughout the school year have offered support  for this approach to explicit teaching of literacy. Over the two years that the library has been in existence, the circulation has increased by 166%. 704 students in 45 classrooms have been able to choose the book they want to read and discuss with fellow readers as a result of the Differentiated Book Loan Library. </span><br />

       <span id='textspan22'>Grade 9 and 10 Applied Strategy</span><span id='textspan23'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan24'>English/Literacy Instructional Leaders began the year working with the Student Success team to conduct   workshops for over 200 teachers of grade 9 and 10 Applied in the areas of Reading Strategies and Writing Strategies. Fifty-five teachers followed up with a three-part module entitled “Lesson Remodeling for Results.” The focus was on utilizing the Three-Part Lesson with engaging </span><span id='textspan25'>literacy strategies in each part. Participants became familiar with “The Literacy Success Diagnostic Kit” and the Academic Workspace Site “Xtreme Literacy.” Each teacher attended an Exploration Classroom in Grade 9 Applied or Grade 10 Locally Developed English as the second of the three parts. Laura Pinto’s book , 95 Strategies for Remodelling Instruction,  provided a basis for the teachers to try new engaging strategies with their students, share their experience with other practitioners, repurpose the strategies, and try again.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan26'>Literacy PLCs that Work</span><span id='textspan27'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan28'>In November 2013 over 100 teachers attended workshops in the east and west regarding Literacy Professional Learning Communities in their schools. In addition, a special day was held for over 40 secondary school administrators. School groups worked on their plans for the year and shared ideas with each other. Special attention was given to “The Short OSSLT Reading Prep Course” which Instructional Leaders have posted on Academic Workspace, and to going over diagnostic results with students to ensure success on the OSSLT. As part of the on-going business of system Literacy Teachers, the group heard brief presentations from school who are engaged in effecting positive literacy change..At the sessions, the leaders learned how to use the students’ results on the OSSLT as a diagnostic, how to interview a student, create a literacy skill profile for that student from test results, and plot next steps to success. Sample videos of the OSSLT Diagnostic Video are posted on Academic Workspace.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan29'>Spoken Word Jams</span><span id='textspan30'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan31'>Twenty-five teachers and over five hundred extremely engaged secondary school students attended one of three Spoken Word Jams this year at either Mackenzie C.I., Rosedale Heights School of the Arts, or Inglenook Community High School. Students and teachers learned together as they attended workshops, readings by professional poets, and an open microphone session where they shared their own work. For each occasion an instant anthology of poems, written by students, entitled “City of Neighbourhoods” was published.</span><br />
