Over 500 students who have missed prior schooling in their countries of origin due to war, refugee situations, political oppression, and conditions of extreme economic hardship are enrolled in LEAP classes.   All students in this enriched academic literacy booster program benefit from literacy, numeracy, and cross-curricular content-based language instruction in an intensive, small-group setting.  For fall 2014, LEAP will be offered in 32 elementary schools and 15 secondary schools across the TDSB.</span><br />

Each book was co-created by English language learners and their teachers, including students from TDSB’s Bloordale Middle School and Kipling C.I.  The resource also includes mathematics lessons and practical tools students will need to successfully increase their financial self-sufficiency through budgeting, banking, saving, and using credit wisely.  Class sets of all fourteen titles are now available to all TDSB ESL/ELD teachers. </span><br />

A highlight of the program was the talk given by Liban Gaashaan, an international telecommunications consultant and former TDSB English language learner.  Liban, who arrived in Canada in 1991 as a refugee from Somalia, attended secondary school at Kipling Collegiate.  He went on to obtain a degree in computer science from York University, and an MBA from Wilfred Laurier University.  Liban has travelled all over the world helping telecommunications companies to provide the highest standard of customer service to cell phone users.  A competitive sprinter, Liban was also chosen as a torch bearer in the 2012 Vancouver Olympics torch relay.  His inspirational presentation concluded with a standing ovation from the Capacity Building for Teachers </span><br />

This collection of student work spotlights the short stories, poetry and artwork of English language learners in our schools in grades one through eight.  This project provides a forum for English language learners to take pride in their writing in their new language, while sharing their experiences in coming to a new country and celebrating their accomplishments in school and in the wider community.  Over 250 students submitted work for consideration in the anthology. </span> <br />

Travelling between several schools with very small numbers of English language learners, itinerant ESL/ELD teachers provide English as a Second Language support to learners in small group settings, as well as offer suggestions to their teachers on the ways to make the classroom program more accessible to children in the early stages of learning English.  A dedicated and expert group of language educators, the itinerant ESL/ELD teachers are well-represented as conference presenters and workshop facilitators across the board. </span> <br />

       <span id='textspan63'>Collaborative Teacher Inquiry Groups</span><span id='textspan64'><br /></span><br /><span id='textspan65'>The ESL/ELD Department received two grants from the Ministry of Education this year to facilitate teacher collaborative inquiry groups for both elementary and secondary ESL/ELD teachers.  The process of collaborative inquiry is a powerful means to change the way educators look at professional learning.  It starts with teachers observing and documenting what students are learning and doing in their classrooms.  Teachers share their observations and documentation and then develop an inquiry question on how they can change an aspect of their classroom practice to increase student learning and success. This model for building teacher professional practice asks teachers to take on the role of classroom researcher to investigate what classroom practices will result in increased student learning. <br /><br />Some of the inquiry questions which group members pursued this year were:<br /><br />How do making personal connections to texts help students increase their reading comprehension?<br />How can explicit teaching of metacognitive reading strategies assist in developing reading proficiency?<br />How does student involvement in creating success criteria affect students’ English language development?</span><br />

The second session emphasized differentiated instruction, strategies for collaborating with classroom teachers to support English language learners in the content areas.  In the final session, teachers concentrated on assessment, evaluation and reporting on the progress of elementary English language learners. </span><br />
