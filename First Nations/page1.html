       <span id='textspan'>Aboriginal Education</span><span id='textspan1'> </span><br /><br /><span id='textspan2'>In 2013-2014 the Aboriginal Education Centre (AEC) continued to focus on closing the opportunity gap and enhancing overall Aboriginal student achievement and well-being by providing wrap-around supports and services directly to individual First Nation, Métis and Inuit students and their families, in addition to serving as an expert resource support for school staff.<br /> <br />Reconfiguring shared space at theBrockton Centre this year has allowed the AEC to create a welcoming space for meeting with the Wisdom and Knowledge Keeper Elder Ed Sackaney, retained by TDSB, as well as to access additional classroom space for professional development, and a Media Lab. The newly-relocated Aboriginal Resource Library houses an extensive collection of Aboriginal content, with over 800 books, sound recordings and videos.  Organized into three teams, AEC staff work with schools and other educators, as well as each other, to ensure that Aboriginal voices, perspectives, experiences and content are infused across all areas of thecurriculum, at all grade levels from Kindergarten to Grade 12, and for all students across the TDSB.<br /><br />For the 2013-2014 school year, AEC staff have focused their efforts in three key areas aligned with the priorities of the Ministry’s </span><span id='textspan3'>Framework</span><span id='textspan4'> and the</span><span id='textspan5'> <br />TDSB Opportunity Gap Action Plan</span><span id='textspan6'>. <br />	<br />1.	Student self-identification; <br />	2. 	Professional learning; and, <br />	3. 	Alignment and integration of 		resources. <br /><br />Within these key areas, a variety of actions and activities reflect the TDSB’s commitment to Aboriginal student achievement and well-being articulated in the Years of Action plan.<br /></span><br />The following are some of the professional learning opportunities provided through the Aboriginal Education Centre during 2013-2014<br />

       <span id='textspan43'>Elders’ Council </span><br /><br /><span id='textspan44'>On February 14, 2014 the Aboriginal Education Centre hosted a day-long gathering of Aboriginal Elders led by Wisdom and Knowledge Keeper Ed Sackaney, and including Elders Pauline Shirt, Vern Harper, Alex Jacobs, Duke Redbird, Joseph Poitras, and Andrew Wesley. The objective of the gathering was to seek the Elders’ assistance and engagement in establishing educational needs and goals in order to move Aboriginal education forward within the system. The Elders encouraged cultivating an attitude of service to the community, and share the understanding that the development of life enhancing and life-preserving values, attitudes and habits must be incorporated into education at an early age. These include the ongoing construction of a sense of responsibility and accountability in preparation for overall family life. Beginning this life process at an early stage will advance positive leadership qualities and capacities, and promote the required knowledge, skills and compliment successful attitudes for the workplace. Clearly defined goals for life, addressing holistic self-development, were discussed.</span><br />
