       <span id='textspan'>New to Kindergarten Module of Learning</span><br /><br /><span id='textspan1'>For the second year in a row, the Early Years Learning and Care department offered a module of learning that was specifically geared to Educators new to teaching kindergarten. This year the module was offered in the Fall and in late Spring. The module of learning included a half day face to face session and a blended learning opportunity where educators were encouraged to go online through Academic Workspace and respond more deeply to areas of kindergarten programming.  The module provided opportunities for educators to become familiar with Ministry of Education and TDSB electronic resources as well as the Full Day Kindergarten Draft program document. We began by embracing the belief of the young child as a competent, curious and capable, and then proceeded to look at how this asset based view influences each educator’s role in creating the Learning Environment as “the third teacher.”   We looked at the importance of intentional play and inquiry based learning and the critical role educator’s play in that learning. The emphasis in the online modules on Academic Workspace was on other areas of programming such as, self-regulation, assessment, parent engagement and the complimentary partnership between ECEs and teachers.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan5'>Using Technology to Support Learning in K-2 Classrooms</span><span id='textspan6'><br /></span><span id='textspan7'><br /></span><span id='textspan8'>This session was designed to support teachers with incorporating their existing classroom technology to enhance learning for all students.  Educators examined the TDSB ICT Standards document and engaged in professional dialogue about the effective use of technology in the classroom.  Research shows that open-ended tasks and activities promote higher order thinking skills; the use of technology should be no exception.  To prepare the 21st century learners for the future, educators must be selective with the programs that we introduce to our students.  Technology can actually deter the use of higher order thinking skills if we are not careful in selecting programs that promote problem solving and creativity.  Educators were encouraged to bring iPads and laptops to the session to learn about and try a number of apps that promote higher order thinking skills in students.  A classroom teacher was invited to share practical ways to use a variety of apps to promote creativity and collaboration.  A number of apps were also shared to document student learning.  Please visit our Early Years AW site for more ideas about the use of technology in the K-2 classrooms. </span> <br />

       <span id='textspan9'>Explore Arts </span><br /><br /><span id='textspan10'>Early Years collaborated with the Arts and Music departments and, twice during the year, offered a three part module to 25 Kindergarten and Grade One educators. This highly sought after PD engaged educators in reflecting and learning about effective and thoughtful teaching of the arts in the early years. Sessions on Visual Arts, Music and Drama/Dance engaged participants in learning fundamentals and considering teaching strategies and documentation. Teachers increased their comfort level, knowledge and repertoire of pedagogical strategies and, between sessions, implemented ideas with their students. Links between sessions provided opportunities for sharing and for demonstration of the integration between artistic disciplines. Educators learned about how to support children’s creative development and structure their environment to support this, for example with open-ended materials at a carefully organized art studio. Teachers learned how the arts can support creative thinking, learning and communication of ideas in all subject areas.</span><br />

During these sessions, educators had the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue about mathematical thinking in kindergarten.<br /><br />  During session one, we examined ways in which mathematical concepts emerge in play.  Educators shared strategies about ways to extend and challenge student thinking and to deepen their mathematical understanding.<br />  <br />Using the resource “Growing Mathematical Ideas in Kindergarten,” teachers were encouraged to introduce intentionally placed materials in their classrooms and share the documentation of student learning at the second session as well as on the Early Years Academic Workspace.<br /><br />https://aw.tdsb.on.ca/tabid/27141/g/posts/t/21327/March-s-Article-Discussion--Mathematical-Thinking-in-Kindergarten.aspx<br /><br />Through a carousel activity, educators had an opportunity to engage in a number of math activities adapted from the Guide to Effective Instruction in Mathematics.  There were wonderful conversations about effective programming and ways to engage and challenge students with play and inquiry based learning.</span><br />

The first part of this three-part module offered Educators an opportunity to examine the ministry resource entitled, </span><span id='textspan24'>“Supporting English Language Learners in Kindergarten.”</span><span id='textspan25'> Educators were participated in discussions that looked at who the English Language Learners in our TDSB classrooms are and ways to support ELLs and their families in all aspects of school life.  Participants also focused on the importance of relaying the notion that the ongoing development of home languages for young children is not only tied to children’s identity, but to their success at school in developing English language skills. In looking at strategies that can been used to create and maintain a linguistically inclusive classroom, participants were introduced to the research and work done by Associate Professor in the School of Early Childhood Studies at Ryerson University, Dr. Roma Chumak-Horbatsch.<br /><br />For more information on the work done by Dr. Roma Chumak-Horbatsch, please visit the site: http://www.mylanguage.ca/</span><br />

The intended goal was to explore a question on a topic of interest that pushed us all to the edge of our understanding while collaboratively gaining new insights. Our hope was that our collective findings and new learning would ultimately impact practice across the school board and province by way of a Ministry monograph.</span><br />

       <span id='textspan32'>Each school set out to collaboratively discover the new learning that would emerge from this question.  To support their exploration, we encouraged all of the educators to reflect on ways they incorporated an inquiry stance, problem solving or a focus on mathematical processes in their teaching of mathematics.  We also provided extensive support on the ways they might capture and document the learning.All of the participants in the EPCI initiative expressed that they had many pivotal moments of learning throughout and that it was a worthwhile experience.

The 78 PFLC’s in TDSB offers families with their babies to 6 year olds a free play-based program that supports children’s early learning and enhances the pre-schoolers development. EDI research indicates that children who attended PFLC’s demonstrated consistent gains in the 5 domains of learning at school entry. Successful transitions to school are a predictor of student achievement in Grade 8. The centres provide support to families in communities that have traditionally faced challenges entering our school system and enable the parents and caregivers the ability to engage actively and positively in their child’s development and learning. The focus is on supporting the health and well-being of both the child and the family. Approximately 14,000 preschoolers with their families visit a PFLC on an annual basis.</span><br />

These sessions supported the implementation of the goals for Early Years in literacy outlined in the Years of Action. The overarching question for all three sessions was, “How do educators work collaboratively to create differentiated learning environments that support and scaffold children’s literacy learning?”<br /><br />In the first of the three sessions, Scaffolding Literacy Development of Young Children, Kindergarten educators had the opportunity to come together with representatives from the Before and After School Childcare providers to begin a journey in thinking about literacy in our Kindergarten programs.  Educators were introduced to the Ontario Early Years Framework Policy (2013) and the vision of collaboration between all those involved in supporting children’s learning.<br /><br />Participants reflected on aspects of their environment that supported children’s literacy development and planned for continued collaboration and planning with all involved parties in further developing their learning spaces. Learning about the reciprocity between oral language, reading and writing, comprehensive literacy and the zone of proximal development, educators were challenged to reflect on their current practice and their timetable and to plan future actions that would support student achievement. Following the session, educators had a half day to work as a school team with childcare partners to further implement the ideas from the session.</span><br />

This means that the teacher supports   the learner in building neural networks   which comprise the ‘in-the-head’ working   systems for literacy learning.”  (Clay, M. (2010). The Puzzling Code,  page 8)<br /><br />Using scenarios of typical children attending FDK educators planned how to link theory into practice. For each scenario educators agreed on the zone of proximal development, those just right teaching opportunities, and planned for intentional next steps for instruction and how to develop experiences to engage families in supporting next steps at home. Being able to view a guided reading lesson in a Kindergarten classroom also supported this work.<br /><br />By the end of the morning educators were exploring how text characteristics can influence the child’s expectations about reading. <br /><br />• A diet of texts with one style of writing   (for example pattern texts) may not lead   to sufficiently flexible reading strategies   for the variety of texts that a reader will   encounter.” (Clay, M. (1991). Becoming   Literate: The Construction of Inner   Control)<br /><br />Educators discussed how story books are more facilitative than repetitive patterned texts in fostering reading acquisitions.The afternoon session focused entirely on analyzing running records for sources of information used and neglected. Using a case study of a one child’s reading educators developed a hypothesis of how a student was responding to text reading and discussed intentional teaching interactions that would support this child to develop as a reader.</span><br />

During this half-day session, educators examined how to plan and identify rich oral language opportunities, how to document and assess oral language, how to develop strategies to support differentiated instruction and how to foster conversations to enhance academic vocabulary and higher order thinking. <br /><br />During this interactive session, educators explored various open-ended materials and then used iPads to photograph and document the learning.  Participants were introduced to a website called, “padlet” where they posted their photographs of the open-ended materials and added rich, higher level questions that they may ask their students.  The padlet walls were saved and posted onto the Early Years AW site for educators to revisit the learning from other sessions.</span><br />

We devoted a lot of time to ensure that resources, links to websites, announcements, Ministry documents and articles were regularly updated.  Our intention was to build consistency in messaging and really build a culture of collaboration in a virtual online learning environment.  Each month we posted professional articles with questions with a goal to provoke thinking and rethinking of early years practices.  Many educators posted reflections from their own classrooms and/or dialogued with others about issues connected to teaching and learning.  While we have made significant progress and many people are beginning to access the site regularly, there is always room for improvement.  In the upcoming year, we plan to continue to make Academic Workspace in the Early Years a priority and hope that it becomes a venue that will be seen as a viable means of informal professional learning.</span><br />
